#  Cybersecurity Internship - Task 1: Scanning Local Network for Open Ports

##  Objective:
Scan the local network to discover open ports and understand network exposure using Nmap and optional analysis with Wireshark.

---

##  Tools Used:
- Kali Linux (OS)
- Nmap (Port Scanner)
- Wireshark (Optional - Packet Analysis)

---

##  Tool Installation:
Nmap and wireshark are pre-installed on Kali Linux. 

## Find Local IP Range

```  
ip a
```
 
Look for your local IP and subnet, e.g., 192.168.29.0/24

## Run TCP SYN Scan  
```
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.29.0/24
```

### Explanation:  

**`sudo`:** Required for privileged scans.

**`nmap`:** The scanning tool.

**`-sS`:** TCP SYN (half-open) scan.

**`192.168.29.0/24`:** Scans all IPs from 192.168.29.1 to 192.168.29.254.  
## Save Scan Results
```
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.29.0/24 -oN network_scan_results.txt
 ```
**`sudo`**: Runs the command with superuser (administrator) privileges, which is often required for some types of network scans.   

**`nmap`**: The Network Mapper tool, used for network discovery and security auditing.    

**`-sS`**: Performs a "TCP SYN scan" (also known as a stealth scan). This is fast and less likely to be detected by the target system because it doesnâ€™t complete the full TCP handshake.    

**`192.168.29.0/24`**: The target network range. This specifies all IP addresses from 192.168.29.0 to 192.168.29.255 (a typical local network).    

**`-oN network_scan_results.txt`**: Outputs the scan results to a file named network_scan_results.txt in a human-readable (normal) format.  

#### In summary:
This command runs an nmap stealth scan on all devices in the 192.168.29.0/24 network and saves the results to a file called network_scan_results.txt.

### Key Learnings:  

- Open ports reveal the network services running on devices, such as FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, Telnet, and others.
- Each service has associated security risks, for example:
  - FTP and Telnet transmit data in plaintext, exposing credentials.
  - DNS can be vulnerable to cache poisoning.
  - UPnP and SIP services have known exploit paths if not properly secured.
- Understanding these risks is essential for network defense and hardening exposed services.
- Performing scans in a controlled environment builds foundational skills in network reconnaissance and penetration testing.
This task provided practical experience with essential cybersecurity tools and concepts, reinforcing the importance of proactive network security assessments.
